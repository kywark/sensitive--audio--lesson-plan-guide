This project is an example classroom lesson informed by AudiAnnotate's ["Presenting Sensitive Audio Using AudiAnnotate" lesson](https://hipstas.github.io/AudiAnnotate/lessonplan.html), both created by Bethany Radcliff and Kylie Warkentin. This lesson uses the ["'Criminal Syndicalism' Case, McComb, Mississippi (Side 1)" recording](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll1/id/37/rec/1) from the [John Beecher Sound Recordings Collection](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll1) at the [University of Texas's Harry Ransom Center](https://www.hrc.utexas.edu). 

To use this project as a lesson, first read through the full outline of the lesson below. Each step of the lesson has been split into different items in the project (displayed as links on [the project page](https://bethanycayeradcliff.github.io/sensitive--audio--lesson-plan-guide/). The [Teacher's Guide]() includes a lesson plan and steps for the instructor teaching this material. The [Student Guide] is the student-facing guide that will walk students through the interactive portions of the lesson. 

For additional resources regarding working with sensitve audio in the classroom, see the "Additional Resources" below.  


# Beecher Criminal Syndicalism Case, McComb, Mississippi (Side 1) Sample Lesson Plan (1 hour)

### Description
Students will understand the processes and philosophy behind audio annotations, with the possibility of presenting annotations using AudiAnnotate. Students will learn about the annotation process, and instructors will be provided with documentation on how to create an AudiAnnotate project. 

> **_Note:_**  Instructors may choose to either focus lesson on thinking through the annotation process and reserve uploading annotations to AudiAnnotate themselves, or they may have students create GitHub accounts and work on presenting their annotations in a project in AudiAnnotate themselves. The lesson plan includes both options (see ***“POTENTIAL Student Group Work: Uploading annotations to AudiAnnotate”***). We have also included a potential extension activity using [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is) to workshop and comment on student annotations (see ***“POTENTIAL Extension Activity Using Hypothesis”***).

### Targeted Lesson Guidelines
***(Modified from [Guidelines for Primary Source Literacy](https://www2.archivists.org/sites/all/files/GuidelinesForPrimarySourceLiteracy-June2018.pdf))***

***Interpret, Analyze, and Evaluate***
- Critically evaluate the perspective of the creator(s) of a primary source, including tone, subjectivity, and biases, and consider how these relate to the original purpose(s) and audience(s) of the source.
- Situate a primary source in context by applying knowledge about the time and culture in which it was created; the author or creator; its format, genre, publication history; or related materials in a collection.
- As part of the analysis of available resources, identify, interrogate, and consider the reasons for silences, gaps, contradictions, or evidence of power relationships in the documentary record and how they impact the research process.
- Factor physical and material elements into the interpretation of primary sources including the relationship between container (binding, media, or overall physical attributes) and informational content, and the relationship of original sources to physical or digital copies of those sources.
Demonstrate historical empathy, curiosity about the past, and appreciation for historical sources and historical actors.


### Lesson Goals
**Instructors will:**
- Introduce students to thinking through audio and the annotation process using primary source materials, paying special attention to working with challenging audio.
- Discuss the context of the chosen audio and provide a content warning.

**Students will:**
- Discuss working with audio archival materials and creating annotations as a class.
- Break into small groups and apply what they’ve learned about using audio a by generating annotations for the Beecher clip that may then be added to AudiAnnotate project by instructor.

### Key Questions
- How do modern researchers  work with archival audio materials, particularly if they contain sensitive content still felt keenly today? 
- How can creating and eventually presenting annotations add to researchers’ meaning making with primary source audio archival materials?

### Lesson Resoures
- [Link](https://kywark.github.io/example-beecher-syndicalism-lesson/lesson-clip-from-criminal-syndicalism-case-mccomb-mississippi-side-1-/#?c=&m=&s=&cv=) to item marking lesson clip of Beecher recording
- Method to record annotations (e.g., Google Sheets, Excel Spreadsheet, paper, etc.). You may choose to use [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1ImjhjLD1g-lQulJX3UJe4Y91z04EOriYCqiN1rz9gnw/copy#gid=0) provided by AudiAnnotate for creating annotations in Google Sheets.
- (Optional) Hypothesis account

### Lesson Plan Agenda Outline (See Individual Items for Further Detail)
1. Whole Class Discussion: How do I think critically about and work with audio? Where do I listen for and make meaning in audio? (6min)
2. Whole Class Discussion: How do we discuss and annotate this audio? What are some potential annotation routes? (20min)
3. Student Group Work: Analyzing audio in groups (8-10min) <em> This would potentially be a good spot to break up this lesson into multiple days: intro material and groupwork.</em>
4. Whole Class/Potential Closing: Brief Presentations with Instructor Evaluation (8min)
5. POTENTIAL Extension Activity Using Hypothesis (10min or homework)

<em>Social Annotation:</em>
- Chapter 6 of Annotation, by Remi Kalir and Antero Garcia, discusses how annotation is used as a classroom learning aid for both students and teachers. This chapter focuses on annotation as a valuable part of anchored discussion in classrooms, but also how annotation is something that can be intimidating to students at first.
