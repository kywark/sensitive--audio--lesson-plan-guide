## Before the Lesson

This project is an example classroom lesson informed by AudiAnnotate's ["Presenting Sensitive Audio Using AudiAnnotate" lesson](https://hipstas.github.io/AudiAnnotate/lessonplan.html), both created by Bethany Radcliff and Kylie Warkentin. This lesson uses the ["'Criminal Syndicalism' Case, McComb, Mississippi (Side 1)" recording](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll1/id/37/rec/1) from the [John Beecher Sound Recordings Collection](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll1) at the [University of Texas's Harry Ransom Center](https://www.hrc.utexas.edu). 

To use this project as a lesson, first read through the full outline of the lesson below. Each step of the lesson has been split into different items in the project (displayed as links on [the project page](https://bethanycayeradcliff.github.io/sensitive--audio--lesson-plan-guide/). The [Teacher's Guide]() includes a lesson plan and steps for the instructor teaching this material. The [Student Guide] is the student-facing guide that will walk students through the interactive portions of the lesson. 

For additional resources regarding working with sensitve audio in the classroom, see the [Teacher's Guide]().

## Asynchronous Mini Lesson

### Description:
Documentation and resources provided as an asynchronous lesson to be completed before synchronous lesson in class. This should take about 30 minutes to complete, including listening to the audio.

### Lesson Goals:
- Students and instructors will review annotation documentation materials and listen/explore AudiAnnotate project with Side 1 of the Beecher audio from the Harry Ransom Center.
- Instructors will review AudiAnnotate documentation materials. 

### About the Audio:
In this lesson, students will be working with the ["'Criminal Syndicalism' case, McComb, Mississippi (Side 1)"](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll1/id/37/rec/1) from the [John Beecher Sound Recordings Collection](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll1) at the [University of Texas’s Harry Ransom Center](https://www.hrc.utexas.edu). We have created an item in this project ("Lesson Clip from "'Criminal Syndicalism' case, McComb, Mississippi (Side 1)") for students to listen to the clip used in the lesson with the warnings for the racial slur and explicit language. <strong>Though this information is reproduced above the item in this project, we recommend instructor(s) share the following information about the audio with students in advance of the synchronous lesson so students may be better prepared to work with the sensitive material or express any discomfort that may prevent them from engaging with the lesson.</strong>

**Recording Description:** This recording was recorded October 19, 1964 by John Beecher and his wife, Barbara. The recording begins with John Beecher and members of the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) meeting with Black high school students and their parents after these students were released from jail in McComb, Mississippi on charges of criminal syndicalism, in which it seems the students have been falsely accused of damaging property by throwing a brick. Beecher speaks with the group about the importance of voting and fighting for equal treatment in the voting process. A white arrested member of COFO discusses how his experience in jail was different than that of the Black students, how he was released without bond, and that his release was sooner. The students discuss the conditions in the jail and the treatment by policemen and guards. The parents of the students discuss how they were given limited interaction with their children, and how officers made visits a challenge.

**Audio Content Warning:** In this recording, a racial slur is used at 16:06 by a student quoting the language said to them by a police officer while in jail. There is also explicit language used at 15:49, 16:30, and 16:39 by students quoting white police officers. Listening to the second side of the recording is not necessary for this lesson and will not be discussed in this lesson, but as a warning, it includes multiple racial slurs, at 4:58, said by a white man; at 5:48 by a man quoting a police officer; at 7:00, 7:04, 7:08, 7:09, by a woman quoting a police officer; at 9:15 by a man quoting a police officer; at 11:42, 11:57, and 12:32  by a woman quoting a police officer. Explicit language is also used by a woman quoting a police officer at 10:48.

**Description of Clip Used in Lesson:** The clip we will discuss in class is 14:07-15:37. In this portion of the recording, Beecher asks the students if they had recreational privileges while in jail, to which the students reply they could not even leave the cell. Beecher asks about food given to them in prison, which the students say was often cold pork and beans from the can, and that they were denied coffee, and given a small breakfast. The students also discuss how the guards/officers were dismissive of their singing and would threaten to drag their mattresses out and make the students sleep on the concrete if they continued sleeping.

### Steps for Instructor(s):
Access AudiAnnotate's [documentation](https://hipstas.github.io/AudiAnnotate/documentation.html) to:
- <strong>Create a GitHub account.</strong> You will need this to login to AudiAnnotate.
- <strong>Create a project in AudiAnnotate.</strong> This project will host all your student groups' annotations for the Beecher "Criminal Syndicalism" recording.
- <strong>Create item(s) in AudiAnnotate.</strong> We recommend you create one item per student group. 
- <strong>Familiarize yourself with general functions and best practices of AudiAnnotate.</strong> Depending on the skill level of your class, you may choose to have students create their own GitHub accounts to work with AudiAnnotate directly or you may upload and present group annotations by yourself. This lesson is written with the latter in mind, but can be easily adapted for students to follow the same steps in the documentaiton to work directly with AudiAnnotate themselves.

After familiarizng yourself with AudiAnnotate, be sure to provide your students with the link to the ["Lesson Clip from "'Criminal Syndicalism' case, McComb, Mississippi (Side 1)"](https://kywark.github.io/example-beecher-syndicalism-lesson/lesson-clip-from-criminal-syndicalism-case-mccomb-mississippi-side-1-/#?c=&m=&s=&cv=) for students to listen to before class. You may also choose to share with students [this fully fleshed out Beecher recording project](https://kywark.github.io/beecher-syndicalism/), created by Bethany Radcliff and Kylie Warkentin.

## Beecher Criminal Syndicalism Case, McComb, Mississippi (Side 1) Sample Lesson Plan (1 hour)

### Description
Students will understand the processes and philosophy behind audio annotations, with the possibility of presenting annotations using AudiAnnotate. Students will learn about the annotation process, and instructors will be provided with documentation on how to create an AudiAnnotate project. 

> **_Note:_**  Instructors may choose to either focus lesson on thinking through the annotation process and reserve uploading annotations to AudiAnnotate themselves, or they may have students create GitHub accounts and work on presenting their annotations in a project in AudiAnnotate themselves. The lesson plan includes both options (see ***“POTENTIAL Student Group Work: Uploading annotations to AudiAnnotate”***). We have also included a potential extension activity using [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is) to workshop and comment on student annotations (see ***“POTENTIAL Extension Activity Using Hypothesis”***).

### Targeted Lesson Guidelines
***(Modified from [Guidelines for Primary Source Literacy](https://www2.archivists.org/sites/all/files/GuidelinesForPrimarySourceLiteracy-June2018.pdf))***

***Interpret, Analyze, and Evaluate***
- Critically evaluate the perspective of the creator(s) of a primary source, including tone, subjectivity, and biases, and consider how these relate to the original purpose(s) and audience(s) of the source.
- Situate a primary source in context by applying knowledge about the time and culture in which it was created; the author or creator; its format, genre, publication history; or related materials in a collection.
- As part of the analysis of available resources, identify, interrogate, and consider the reasons for silences, gaps, contradictions, or evidence of power relationships in the documentary record and how they impact the research process.
- Factor physical and material elements into the interpretation of primary sources including the relationship between container (binding, media, or overall physical attributes) and informational content, and the relationship of original sources to physical or digital copies of those sources.
Demonstrate historical empathy, curiosity about the past, and appreciation for historical sources and historical actors.


### Lesson Goals
**Instructors will:**
- Introduce students to thinking through audio and the annotation process using primary source materials, paying special attention to working with challenging audio.
- Discuss the context of the chosen audio and provide a content warning.

**Students will:**
- Discuss working with audio archival materials and creating annotations as a class.
- Break into small groups and apply what they’ve learned about using audio a by generating annotations for the Beecher clip that may then be added to AudiAnnotate project by instructor.

### Key Questions
- How do modern researchers  work with archival audio materials, particularly if they contain sensitive content still felt keenly today? 
- How can creating and eventually presenting annotations add to researchers’ meaning making with primary source audio archival materials?

### Lesson Resoures
- [Link](https://kywark.github.io/example-beecher-syndicalism-lesson/lesson-clip-from-criminal-syndicalism-case-mccomb-mississippi-side-1-/#?c=&m=&s=&cv=) to item marking lesson clip of Beecher recording
- Method to record annotations (e.g., Google Sheets, Excel Spreadsheet, paper, etc.). You may choose to use [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1ImjhjLD1g-lQulJX3UJe4Y91z04EOriYCqiN1rz9gnw/copy#gid=0) provided by AudiAnnotate for creating annotations in Google Sheets.
- (Optional) Hypothesis account

### Lesson Plan Agenda Outline (See Individual Items for Further Detail)
1. Whole Class Discussion: How do I think critically about and work with audio? Where do I listen for and make meaning in audio? (6min)
2. Whole Class Discussion: How do we discuss and annotate this audio? What are some potential annotation routes? (20min)
3. Student Group Work: Analyzing audio in groups (8-10min) <em> This would potentially be a good spot to break up this lesson into multiple days: intro material and groupwork.</em>
4. Whole Class/Potential Closing: Brief Presentations with Instructor Evaluation (8min)
5. POTENTIAL Extension Activity Using Hypothesis (10min or homework)
